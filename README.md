MiniLD 61

Herein lies my MiniLD 61 entry.

Dependencies
------------

To build this entry you will need:

- SFML 2

The Game/Theme
--------------

The theme is "A Necessary Weakness", where the weakness in question is one of mine as a game developer.
So this game is built to focus around my weaknesses for art and music, whereupon IÃ›C plan on making a game much like the old *Raptor: Call of the Shadows*. Complete with large scrolling backdrops, proper soundtrack, and sound effects.
Also planning on giving it proper graphical fidelity, since I usually stick with vector art and simpler pixel art stuff.
